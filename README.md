Library Management System

This Repository represents creating a database from scratch using MySQL and Visual Studio's .NET framework. 
To start, I was given a document describing the relationship between Students, Admin, Professors, Departments, Classes, etc., 
and had to create an ER diagram to visualize the relationships. 
Next, I created the tables in MySQL with the appropriate properties. After the tables were established, I produced a project using LINQ, 
C#, .NET, and Visual Studio to create an interface for Students, Professors, and Admin to perform their duties and update the database. 
The code prevents illegal arguments and SQL injection attacks.
